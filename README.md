I use [jrnl](https://github.com/maebert/jrnl) to store a lot of stuff. This is my try at a web based frontend for it. I don't really know what I want from this, so I'll continue adding whatever feels cool to me.

A poc is [live here](http://167.88.124.249/~dufferzafar/jrnl/idea.html).

This assumes that your jrnl entries are written in the markdown format.

## todo

* Separate html view and jrnl data
    - By loading data from a json file

* Angular based live search
    - tag:python
    - starred:yes

* After search is added, convert @tags to links 

* Order cards from left to right and top to bottom,
rather than top to bottom and left to right
